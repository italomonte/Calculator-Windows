# Calculator with Tkinter
In this project, I decided to challenge myself and try to create a calculator from scratch with the same features as the one contained in Windows 10. I went through some challenges involving the graphic part and some obstacles in the syntax for everything to work smoothly and correctly.

In the development I used the Tkinter library, being able to absorb a lot of knowledge of it, and exploring almost all its functionalities.

Some of the features:
Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Percentage, Square Root, Square, etc.

Here are some screenshots of the calculator in action:
